- need to somehow get the yum package from online
- read its spec

- Get an installed version of the Yum
 - install to a variant folder
- alternative: get the source version of the yum and use that + make it install-able
 - probably going to be much more difficult to do

- need variant information for the yum package
- download it to a package location (needs a variant, too)

- requirement names need to be converted from YUM style to Rez style
- do this recursively for each requirement
