Test Cases
- Multi package issues
 - 2 or more packages at once have some incompatible issue
- Handle errors due to added or removed **ephemerals**


- The report should say
 - The first index that has the problem (+ include the request that failed)
 - Diff that index with the previous one, show its result
 - If --partial is included, **guess** what the issue could be, based on the diff

- Standard git bisect interactivity
