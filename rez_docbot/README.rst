TODO Add links here, later.

A simple tool to publish .html files to remote repositories (e.g. GitHub).
It's meant to be used in conjugation with other tools. For example,
as a plug-in for ``rez_sphinx`` (TODO add link).

See documentation for details: TODO


Documentation
- New documentation should be tagged (with package name + version, like Rez does it)
- Check that I have references for all :ref: tags.
- Do NotImplementedHere exceptions
- Do all TODO notes
