TODO Make sure to mention this tool is meant to use git
 - Also how do I handle multiple handler plug-ins?
 - e.g. just loading the requires for github publishing, vs bitbucket

    rez_sphinx_help:User Documentation

``rez_docbot`` is a simple documentation publisher. It takes generated
documentation, usually .html files or a directory, and pushes them to a remote
destination like `GitHub`_.

Beyond that, this tool doesn't do all that much. It comes with lots of
:doc:`configuration options <configuring_rez_docbot>`, but most users
will never need to touch them.

``rez_docbot`` also exists as a plug-in for :ref:`rez_sphinx`. Effectively, it
gives :ref:`rez_sphinx` publishing capabilities which it normally would not be
able to do.

To learn how to administer ``rez_docbot`` to a pipeline, see
:doc:`developer_documentation`.
