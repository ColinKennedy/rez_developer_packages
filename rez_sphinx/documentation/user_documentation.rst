TODO : Visit this tutorial once rez_docbot exists. And possibly update it with
remote information.

Welcome to ``rez_sphinx``, the missing link between `Rez`_ and `Sphinx`_.
``rez_sphinx`` automatically initializes, interlinks, configures, and builds
documentation in your Rez packages. It even links to **other** Rez packages if
they also have documentation. ``rez_sphinx`` does all this so you can do what
you want to do, faster. Which is writing good docs!

TODO : Make this rez_docbot link work

``rez_sphinx`` is also a plug-in for :ref:`rez_docbot
<rez_docbot:user_documentation>` The documentation below mostly just goes over
``rez_sphinx`` on its own but may mention it from time to time.
