Welcome to ``rez_sphinx``, the missing link between `Rez`_ and `Sphinx`_.
``rez_sphinx`` automatically initializes, interlinks, configures, and builds
documentation in your Rez packages. It even links to **other** Rez packages if
they also have documentation. ``rez_sphinx`` does all this so you can do what
you want to do, faster. Which is writing good docs!

``rez_sphinx`` is includes an external website publisher plug-in called
:ref:`rez_docbot <rez_docbot:user_documentation>`. The documentation here
mostly just goes over ``rez_sphinx`` on its own but
:ref:`rez_docbot:rez_docbot` may mentioned from time to time.

To learn more about how to use :ref:`rez_sphinx`, check out
:doc:`user_documentation`.
